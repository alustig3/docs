# pyControl

Controlling behavioural experiments using Micropython.

---

## Overview

**pyControl** is a system of open source software and hardware for controlling behavioural experiments, built around the [Micropython](https://micropython.org/) microcontroller.

pyControl makes it easy to program complex behavioural tasks by providing a clean, intuitive, and flexible Python based syntax for specifying tasks as state machines.  For more information see [programming tasks](user-guide/programming-tasks.md)
