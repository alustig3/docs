# Contributing to pyControl

An introduction to contributing to the pyControl project.

The pyControl project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers and
users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of
ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the pyControl project's codebases, issue trackers, chat
rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct].

## Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and pyControl
version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please
add a screenshot and if you get an error please include the full error and
traceback.
